    "        </ul>\n",

    "    <li> Having implemented your algorithm, the second activity asks you to examine it's performance as the <em>complexity</em> of the combination lock changes. <ul> \n",

    "            <li> The task is to use experiments and reasoning to answer a number of interactive multiple-choice questions.</li>\n",

    "          <li> Task 3 is to write a method that combines array slicing with some simple string processing to extract a set of values from a text database</li>\n",
    "          <li> For those that feel confident, Task 4 is to combine code snippets from these cells to create a new method that could be used as part of a different problem<br> - evaluating an attempt to solve a Sudoku problem.</li>\n",
